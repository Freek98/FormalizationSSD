* Re-organizing the repo so the dependency structure (what imports what) makes more sense. 
+ StoneDuality currently contains a bunch of stuff on the Sp-decidable-subsets adjunction and anti-equivalence. This should move to a seperate file. The whole Category theory folder and everything in it is also in this field. I think it's most convenient to let the AI handle this, while I continue with the examples of countably presented Boolean rings.  
+ Countably presented Boolean rings should include Bool, 2/1, Cantor space, B_infty
+ Note that the definition of a Spectrum should not be in Axioms/StoneDuality. This is annoying, as it should not depend on the axioms. So let's think about where to put it.
