The goal of this repository is to formalize the SSD paper (https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.TYPES.2024.3). 
It is supposed to act like the human-read version for formalization work that has been in parts done by an AI. 

Matching to the paper: 
- Definition 1.2 is called is-countable 
- Definition 1.3 is called is-countably-presented 
- Remark 1.4 is called is-countably-presented-equivalence
