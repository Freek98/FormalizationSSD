The goal of today is to organize a private repo with formalizations of the SSD paper to something more presentable. 

In the original repo we had only 3 folders
- the top level folder 
- A folder called "Boole", which was supposed to contain stuff that only relates to countably presented boolean algebras
- A folder called "Category", where the goal was to generalize some immediate conseqeuences of Stone duality to general consequences of an adjunction being an iso. I think this effort should be shelved for now, as we focus on formalizing some results from the paper. 

The main result I wanted to aim for is the classification of closeds in a Stone, but it turns out this was maybe overambitious. Instead, I wish to complete the proofs of the omniscience principles first. 

**TO CHANGE**
- WLPO contains the definition of binary sequences
